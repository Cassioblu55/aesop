Elven Scouts

6 scouts (elves). One scout carries a horn and can use its action to blow it. If the horn is blown within the forest, roll on this table again. If the result indicates a monster encounter, the indicated monster or monsters arrive in 2 minutes. New arrivals other than gnolls, hyenas, owl bears, and displacer beasts are friendly toward the scouts.
