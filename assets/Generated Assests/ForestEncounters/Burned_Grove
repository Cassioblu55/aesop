Burned Grove

A grove of burned trees. Characters searching the area and succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check find gnoll tracks. Following the tracks for 4 hours leads to an encounter with
gnolls, or the discovery of dead gnolls with elven arrows sticking out of their flea-ridden corpses.
